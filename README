This "project" is based on libxmp (4.3.0): The all the "Web" changes are contained in the "emscripten" subfolder.

The main addition is the new adapter.c file: It encapsulates all those APIs that interface with the 
JavaScript/Web world. 


Howto build:

You'll need Emscripten (I used the win installer on WinXP: emsdk-1.13.0-full-32bit.exe which could be found here: 
http://kripken.github.io/emscripten-site/docs/getting_started/downloads.html) I did not need to perform 
ANY additions or manual changes on the installation. The below instructions assume that the libxmp-4.3.0 project 
folder has been moved into the main emscripten folder (maybe not necessary) and that a command prompt has been 
opened within the libxmp-4.3.0/emscripten sub-folder, and that the Emscripten environment vars have been set (run emsdk_env.bat).

Running the makeEmscripten.bat will generate a JavaScript 'xmp' library (webXmp.js) including the above mentioned 
interface APIs. This lib is directly written into the web-page example in the "htdocs" sub-folder. (This generated lib is 
used from some manually written JavaScript/WebAudio code, see htdocs/sample_player.js). Study the example in "htdocs" 
for how the player is used.
